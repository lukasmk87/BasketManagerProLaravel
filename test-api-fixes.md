## Testing the Fixes

### Test Case 1: GET /api/v2/gym-halls/{id}
```bash
# Test with valid gym hall ID
curl -X GET "https://staging.basketmanager-pro.de/api/v2/gym-halls/1" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Test with non-existent gym hall ID  
curl -X GET "https://staging.basketmanager-pro.de/api/v2/gym-halls/999" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

Expected responses:
- Valid ID: 200 OK with gym hall data and computed fields
- Invalid ID: 404 with proper error message
- No longer 500 errors

### Test Case 2: POST /api/v2/time-slots/assign-team-segment
```bash
curl -X POST "https://staging.basketmanager-pro.de/api/v2/time-slots/assign-team-segment" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "gym_time_slot_id": 1,
    "team_id": 1,
    "day_of_week": "monday",
    "start_time": "18:00",
    "end_time": "19:30",
    "notes": "Training session"
  }'
```

Expected responses:
- Valid data: 200 OK with assignment details
- Invalid data: 422 with validation errors
- Conflicts: 422 with conflict details
- Database errors: 422 with user-friendly messages
- No longer 500 errors

## Log Improvements

New logs will include:
- Full request context (URL, user ID, request data)
- Exception stack traces for debugging
- Categorized error types (validation, database, authorization)
- Reduced log spam by filtering common exceptions

## Database Structure Verification

Key tables involved:
1. `gym_halls` - Main hall information
2. `gym_time_slots` - Time slot definitions (day_of_week, start_time, end_time can be nullable)
3. `gym_time_slot_team_assignments` - Team assignments to specific time segments
4. `teams` - Team information
5. `gym_courts` - Court information (optional)

Critical relationships:
- GymHall hasMany GymTimeSlots
- GymTimeSlot hasMany GymTimeSlotTeamAssignments  
- Team hasMany GymTimeSlotTeamAssignments
- GymHall hasMany GymCourts

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these fixes to staging environment
2. Test the API endpoints with the test cases above
3. Monitor Laravel logs for improved error information
4. Verify that 500 errors are eliminated
5. Check that user experience is improved with better error messages

## Files Modified

1. `app/Http/Controllers/Api/GymHallController.php` - Enhanced show() method
2. `app/Http/Controllers/GymManagementController.php` - Enhanced assignTeamToSegment() method  
3. `bootstrap/app.php` - Added comprehensive global error handling

All changes maintain backward compatibility and improve error handling without breaking existing functionality.
